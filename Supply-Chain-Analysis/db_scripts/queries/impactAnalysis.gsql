  /*
    Start from multiple input affected sites, return the impacted site-product pairs. The impacted site-product pairs will be indentified from two paths, one is site-(delivery)-site relationship. Another one is site-(produce)-product-(use)-product relationship. Since not nessesarily all product belongs to a site is getting impacted. To calculte the subset we need infomation from both paths. That is the impacted product needs to use another impacted product delivered from a impacted site. This will require both delivery relationship and dependency relationship between products. Because a delivered product may not be used, a impacted product being used may not delivered from the very impacted site.

    Sample input:
    affectedSites: site5
    maxDepth: 10
